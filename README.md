# Hi, I'm Manasvi  

I'm a software developer with a Bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering from IIT Roorkee. I specialize in building robust, user-focused web applications and APIs. I care about writing maintainable code, automating repetitive tasks, and choosing the right tools for the job.
